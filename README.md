### isoscelles

This package contains useful functions for processing single-cell isoform data, particularly from MASseq / Kinnex experiments. This package is primarily focused on single-cell methods like gene selection, shared-nearest-neighbor calculation, and Leiden clustering. To a large extent these methods are the same as those used for short-read (gene level) scRNAseq.

This package is not to be confused with [Isosceles](https://github.com/Genentech/Isosceles), an R package for transcript detection and quantification. They spelled the name of the triangle correctly, but this one has the word `cell` in it.
